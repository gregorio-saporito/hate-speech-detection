# hate-speech-detection
Hate speech detection plays a pivotal role in preventing the uncontrolled spread of hate online which could have negative repercussions. The aim of this project is to build a classifier capable of discerning among comments considered hateful, offensive, or neither of the two. The intrinsic complexities of natural language processing make this task arduous. This is particularly true when it comes to distinguishing between hateful and offensive content since its boundary is sometimes hard to define.
